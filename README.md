**Feature_Extraction**
 Some useful Time and Frequency domain feature extraction built-in Python codes, with article reference.
<br><br>

Feature Extraction codes, to apply measurements and gain indights on your data.
<br>
Especially for 1D (time-series) physiological signals.

<br><br>

**CODE ORGANIZATION:**
<br>
1)Time-domain features
<br>
2)Frequency-domain features
<br>
3)Time-frequency features
<br>
4)Custom function

<br><br>
1)Time-domain features capture amplitude-based characteristics of the signal.
These features are useful for analyzing the overall structure, intensity, and variability of the signal.

<br><br>
2)Frequency-domain features analyze the spectral content of the signal.
These features are critical for understanding oscillatory components and periodicity.
<br><br>

3)Time-frequency features analyze the signal in both time and frequency domains simultaneously.
These features are useful for non-stationary signals where frequency content changes over time.
<br><br>

4)Define custom functions to use the most appropriate ones, for transforming your data.
